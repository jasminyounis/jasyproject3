    <h2>
      About the project
    </h2>
    <p>
      The inspiration behind this project was the song <i>Alice</i> from Lady Gaga's recent album <i>Chromatica</i>. 
      Chromatic is an album that touches on Gaga's journey with mental health. The land of Chromatica is similar to Wonderland
      filled with twists and turns, but overall there is a path that you end up finding yourself.

      <b><i>Artist statement:</i></b>
   Listening to the song,<i>Alice</i>,reminds me of feeling like Alice in Wonderland, that feeling of being lost and alone but ultimately taking the chance to find yourself. While going through the Three.js website, I found the teapot, and I thought it would be interesting to create a tea set on table and watch
    how the reflections of the environment interact with the glass tea set or how using javascript to create glitch features on the tea set 
    could represent the imperfections. To expand on this project, I would like to add a single room inside a teapot and youâ€™ll just see a persona of Alice posed or interacting in the world within the teapot.
